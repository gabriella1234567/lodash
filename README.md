# Lodash practice project

This is a Lodash practice project for the Codecademy Full Stack Career Path, where I implemented Lodash methods on my own, with the goal of doing as much of it as possible without consulting the hints provided.

## Project Goal

Implement ten preselected Lodash methods, following these steps:

1. Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
2. Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
3. Implement our game plan
4. Test our code to ensure it works as expected
